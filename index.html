        Exploration of the origins of "witch hunts" as a political metaphor (McCathyism), and its use within Trump's Tweets (against impeachment). I can do the same thing with "Watergate" (including etomological origins) turning into "PizzaGate", "Spygate" and "Obamagate". What does this rhetoric do? What does it change? How has it been impactful? Ill do some readings and find out!

        ... In 2016, Michigan voted to FIRE this <em class="ub">corrupt political establishment</em> and you elected an <em class="ur">outsider as President</em> who is finally  <em class="up">putting AMERICA FIRST!</em>

        This tweet highlights the facets of Donald Trump’s twitter presence; an “Outsider” to the antagonistic political establishment, that uniquely stresses the importance of the nation, at the expense of otherized nations. The ascension of Donald Trump to presidency was framed through his distinction as an "outsider", separate from the landed political class. This persona was attractive to voters disinterested in the status quo, positioned as the "anti-establishment candidate" (Lichtman, 2016). 
        <br><br>The dual rhetoric’s of "power", and "powerlessness" are evidenced with the handling of diplomacy and reactions to investigations of misconduct. While holding the presidency - the paramount position of power - Trump had to navigate the often-contradictory interests of international and domestic interests. We will examine how this is achieved, in a way that maintains his facade as the "Outsider".
